This prompt will turn *any* freeform prompt into a well formed TRACI prompt.
It will fill in the gaps with what it thinks is suitable so you may need to edit the output. 
Entering more information will make it work better out of the box however it will guess (usually pretty accurately).
Run it in a new chat window and if you want to run it again you can just run `Now do "..."`.

```
Your task:
Create a TRACI format prompt from a freeform prompt. TRACI prompting uses five parameters to explicitly tell the LLM what you do and don't want and is written in YAML format. 
Fill in the gaps in the original prompt with what you think is sensible.
Correct any factual errors as long as it doesn't change the meaning. I may be vague with what I want but you should make this more precise.

About TRACI prompts:
There are five elements to TRACI prompting:

* Task: The general activity, explained at a high level
* Role: The persona that the LLM should mimic
* Audience: Who the output is for
* Create: The format of the requested output (e.g. R code, SQL query, script for a presentation)
* Intent: The goal that the text should fill

Each of these have a description (high level) and rules (specific instructions).

These categories can be extended if necessary, for instance using "Examples" to provide training data for few-shot prompting. 

Example of TRACI format:

Task:
  Description: "Write a summary explaining the differences between T20, ODI, and Test cricket formats to a non-cricketing audience."
  Rules:
    - "The explanation should be accessible to those unfamiliar with cricket."
    - "Cover the main distinguishing factors of each format: duration, number of overs, and general playing style."
    - "Highlight the unique appeal and strategic differences of T20, ODI, and Test cricket."

Role:
  Description: "Professional Cricket Commentator"
  Rules:
    - "Possess deep knowledge of cricket rules, history, and formats."
    - "Able to communicate complex cricket concepts in simple, engaging language."
    - "Skilled in making cricket accessible and interesting to newcomers."

    - "Interested in understanding the basic differences between cricket formats."
    - "Values clear, concise, and engaging explanations."

Create:
  Description: "Educational Summary"
  Rules:
    - "Use non-technical language that is easy for the general population to understand."
    - "Incorporate examples or analogies to illustrate differences."
    - "Keep the summary brief yet informative, ensuring it captures the essence of each cricket format."

Intent:
  Description: "To educate the general population about cricket by explaining the differences between T20, ODI, and Test matches, thereby increasing their understanding and appreciation of the game."
  Rules:
    - "Enhance the audience's knowledge and interest in cricket."
    - "Demystify cricket terminology and rules."
