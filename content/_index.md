Hello.

I am a data scientist at Amazon, where I have worked on topics such as natural language processing, forecasting, product surveys, and rankings. My previous roles and projects relating to data have covered analyst and data engineering projects and I have worked in HR, finance, and operations.

My degrees are BSc in Mathematics and MSc in Statistics, both from the University of Sheffield. My MSc dissertation was titled Eliciting Probability Distributions, where I researched methodologies and conducted meta-analysis of psychology literature for structuring elicitation sessions and approaches for eliciting personal probabilities, for instance for Bayesian modelling.

In 2024, I joined Wellspring Alternative Academy as a school governor, serving as link governor for finance. Wellspring is an alternative provision school operating across four buildings in Lincolnshire.

All views and work presented on this site are my own.
